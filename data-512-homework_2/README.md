# Considering Bias in Data
## Homework #2
The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment will consider articles on political figures from different countries. For this assignment, you will combine a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article.
You are expected to perform an analysis of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies among countries. Your analysis will consist of a series of tables that show:
1. The countries with the greatest and least coverage of politicians on Wikipedia compared to their population.
2. The countries with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about politicians.
3. A ranking of geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.
You are also expected to write a short reflection on the project that focuses on how both your findings from this analysis and the process you went through to reach those findings helps you understand the causes and consequences of biased data in large, complex data science projects.

## Write-up, Reflections and Implications

**1. What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?**
Interestingly enough, people who browse english wikipedia seemingly don't create higher quality articles for North America. They create higher quality articles for middle eastern countries such as Iraq and Pakistan. This may have been a result of wikipedia being more popularly used during the eras of the Iraq War and political debacles during this time, and the desire to retain more information regarding American soldiers and subsidies.

**2. How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limiations/biases you observed?**
