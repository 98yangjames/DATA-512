# Goal

The goal of this project is determining the implications of temperature and whether it has affect on COVID-19 like it does with the common cold. There are numerous articles that state that the cold weather does not directly make a person sick, but can make a person more susceptible to getting the cold. We explore the validity of this statement through a test on Bergen county located in New Jersey. Through data cleaning, manipulation, and a hypothesis test we can deduce whether or not the temperature has the same effect on COVID-19.
